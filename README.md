# IBMDataAnalystCapstoneProject
Finally, the final project! Thanks to IBM instructors who taught all the necessary information throughout the 9 courses. I tried to spend the course efficiently by following it for 6 months and implementing the projects. Lastly, I wanted to upload my capstone project to Github.

In this project, I take on the role of a Data Analyst for a large international IT and business consulting organization. This organization is known for its expertise in IT solutions and its highly skilled team of IT experts. The company regularly analyzes data to keep up with rapidly evolving technologies and stay competitive, helping to determine future skill requirements. As a data analyst, I supported this program and took on the responsibility of gathering information from various sources and identifying trends for this year's skills development report.
